1. Create some user data in the `userList` collection using Firestore database dashboard. Each user should have the fields of `name`, `gender`, `country`, `city`, `phone`, `picture`. You can refer to the `user_collection.json` to create these data.

2. Use Firebase SDK to get the `userList` data from firestore, and render these user data in [Bootstrap Table](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/content/tables/).

3. User picture should be setting to 25px both in width and height. You can find an example of how to set the element shape to a circle from [this link](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/utilities/borders/).
